        to find significant and important vocabulary from within a natural language text docu
        ment. From the document-level analysis, it is possible to examine collections of docu
        ments. The methods used to do this include clustering and classification. Clustering is
         the process of grouping documents with similar contents into dynamically generated
         clusters. This is in contrast to text categorization, where the process is a bit more
         involved. Here, samples of documents fitting into pre-determined “themes” or “catego
        ries” are fed into a “trainer,” which in turn generates a categorization schema. When the
         documents to be analyzed are then fed into the categorizer, which incorporates the
         schema previously produced, it will then assign documents to different categories based
         on the taxonomy previously provided. These features are incorporated in programs such
         as IBM’s Intelligent Miner for Text (Dorre, Gerstl, & Seiffert, 1999)

         <p class="data"> One area of DM that is attracting a good amount of attention is distributed and
            collective DM. Much of the DM that is being done currently focuses on a DB or data
            warehouse of information that is physically located in one place. However, the situation
            arises where information may be located in different places, or in different physical
            locations. This is known generally as distributed-data mining  (DDM). Therefore, the goal
            is to effectively mine distributed data that are located in heterogeneous sites. DDM is
            used to offer a different approach to traditional approaches to analysis, by using a
            combination of localized data analysis together with a “global data model.” In more
            specific terms, this is defined as performing local data analysis for generating partial data
            models, and combining the local data models from different data sites in order to develop
            the global model.  This global model combines the results of the separate analyses. Often
            the global model produced may become incorrect or ambiguous, especially if the data in
            different locations have different features or characteristics. This problem is especially
            critical when the data in distributed sites are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous.
            These heterogeneous data sets are known as vertically partitioned data sets. An
            approach proposed by Kargupta, Park, Herschberger, and Johnson (2000) speaks of the
            collective data-mining (CDM) approach, which provides a better approach to vertically
            partitioned data sets using the notion of orthonormal basis functions, and computes the
            basis coefficients to generate the global model of the data</p><br>

            <p class="data">The advent of laptops, palmtops, cell phones, and wearable computers is making

                    MINING</b></center>
                    <p class="data">Hypertext and hypermedia DM can be characterized as mining data that includes
                        text, hyperlinks, text markups, and various other forms of hypermedia information. As
                        such, it is closely related to both Web mining and multimedia mining, which are covered
                        separately in this section, but in reality are quite close in terms of content and
                        applications. While the WWW is substantially composed of hypertext and hypermedia
                        elements, there are other kinds of hypertext/hypermedia data sources, including online
                        catalogues, digital libraries, online information DBs, and hyperlink and inter-document
                        structures.</p>
                        <p class="data">Some of the important DM techniques used for hypertext and hypermedia DM
                            include classification (supervised learning), clustering (unsupervised learning),
                            semistructured learning, and social network analysis. In the case of classification, or
                            supervised learning, the process starts off by reviewing training data in which items are
                            marked as being part of a certain class or group. This data are the basis from which the
                            algorithm is trained (Chakrabarti, 2000). Unsupervised learning, or clustering, differs
                            from classification in that while classification involves the use of training data, clustering
                            is concerned with the creation of hierarchies of documents based on similarity and
                            organizes the documents based on that hierarchy. Semi-supervised learning and social
                            network analysis are other methods that are important to hypermedia-based DM.
                            Semisupervised learning is the case where there are both labeled and unlabeled docu
                           ments and there is a need to learn from both types of documents. Social network analysis
                            is also applicable because the Web is considered a social network that examines networks
                            formed through collaborative association (Larson, 1996; Mizruchi, Mariolis, Schwartz,
                            & Mintz, 1986). Other research conducted in the area of hypertext DM includes work on
                            distributed hypertext resource discovery (Chakrabarti, van den Berg, & Dom, 1999).</p><br><br>

                                <p class="data">  Multimedia DM is the mining and analysis of various types of data, including
                                    images, video, audio, and animation. The idea of mining data that contains different kinds
                                    of information is the main objective of multimedia DM (Zaiane, Han, Li, & Hou, 1998). As
                                    multimedia DM incorporates the areas of text mining as well as hypertext/hypermedia
                                    mining, these fields are closely related. Much of the information describing these other
                                    areas also applies to multimedia DM. This field is also rather new, but holds much promise
                                    for the future. A developing area in multimedia DM is that of audio DM (mining music).
                                    The idea is basically to use audio signals to indicate the patterns of data or to represent
                                    the features of DM results. It is possible not only to summarize melodies based on the

                                    based on tone, tempo, or the major musical instruments played (Han & Kamber, 2001;

                                <p class="data"> Aside from statistical or numeric data, it is also important to consider information
                                    that is of an entirely different kind-i.e., spatial and geographic data that could contain
                                    information about astronomical data, natural resources, or even orbiting satellites and
                                    spacecraft that transmit images of earth from out in space. Much of this data is image
                                   oriented and can represent a great deal of information if properly analyzed and mined
                                    (Miller & Han, 2001). Analyzing spatial and geographic data includes such tasks as
                                    understanding and browsing spatial data, uncovering relationships between spatial data
                                    items (and also between non-spatial and spatial items), and also analysis using spatial
                                    DBs and spatial knowledge bases. The applications of these would be useful in such
                                    fields as remote sensing, medical imaging, navigation, and related uses. Some of the
                                    techniques and data structures that are used to analyze spatial and related types of data
                                    include the use of spatial warehouses, spatial data cubes, and spatial On Line Analytic
                                    Processing (OLAP). Spatial data warehouses can be defined as those that are subject
                                   oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, and time-variant (Han, Kamber, & Tung, 2001). Aside
                                    from the implementation of data warehouses for spatial data, there is also the issue of
                                    analyses that can be done on the data. Some of the analyses that can be done include

                                        <p class="data">Another important area in DM centers on the mining of time-series and sequence
                                            based data. Simply put, this involves the mining of a sequence of data that can either be

                                             mining time-series data focuses on the goal of identifying movements or components that
                                             exist within the data (trend analysis). These can include long-term or trend movements,

                                                   ment into DM is in the form of constraint-based DM. This form of DM incorporates the
                                                    use of constraints that guide the process. Frequently, this is combined with the benefits
                                                    of multidimensional mining to add greater power to the process (Han, Lakshamanan, &
                                                    Ng, 1999). There are several categories of constraints that can be used, each with its own
                                                    characteristics and purpose. These include<i> knowledge-type constraints</i>, that specify

                                                    of any DM query. Some of the types of constraints that can be used include clustering,

                                                    the specific DM query. Since constraint-based mining is ideally conducted within the
